With reference to PO00036505 which was cancelled as the invoices relating to period year end 31/12/2013 were paid without a purchase order, however the submitted requisition should have been described as, ``year end 31/12/2013``, as opposed to ``31/12/2014`` stated. As a result the following purchase orders PO00034175 and PO00041818 were incorrectly described as payment for estate charges to year end 31/12/2015 and 31/12/2016 respectively. PO00034175 shold have been described as charges to year end 31/12/2014, as the invoices received are paid in arrears.
